Summary: Part 2 of an analysis into the comic industry

#Part 2:  Sales
In [part 1 of my analysis](part1) I looked at the most popular comics of the last 20 years. What about sales? I kept discussion about the business separate from discussion of the titles. 

For this I choose to look at publishers rather than series, to see the relative performance at publisher level, because this is where sales matter.

From this we see why DC and Marvel are called the Big Two, they have a huge lead in terms of sales. Interestingly Marvel is outselling DC by a significant margin. The obvious question here is "Are Marvel better than DC?"
