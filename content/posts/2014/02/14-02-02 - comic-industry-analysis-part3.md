#Part 3 - Creatives
Ok, we've delved into the sales figure and titles, but that tells us so little about the creatives involved in the work. Firstly we should consider the number of creatives working in the industry, in all fields

Most popular

So can we look at this data and see the impact an artist has on a title? One measure of such creatives might be the sales their work on titles generate, above or below average. This doesn't take into account trends (if a character isn't as popular as they used to be) and can't separate the individual contributions of members of a tight-knit creative team, but it serves as a decent guideline for some interesting analysis.

Let's look at three roles, writer, artist and colourist and see how much the average person in these roles appears to impact the comics they make.

###The most impactful creatives of the last 20 years.

Another question about creatives: Have they become more prolific in the last twenty years? 

Most prolific

This shows us something interesting?

I  graphed them, with a creative sitting on the chart at number of comics worked on and debut year.
